# TicTacToeWithAI

After making the simple TicTacToe for school, I decided that it would be interesting to make one that actually plays back.
Turns out a computer randomly placing squares is incredibly easy to beat. So I programmed in a bit of logic. 
Then I was interested, so I figured out every possible sequence for a perfect game of TicTacToe, and programmed them in so that
the computer would never lose. I had fun!
